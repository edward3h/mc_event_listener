# Minecraft Event Listener

A web service to listen for events from a Minecraft Bedrock server, and display recent data.

## Setup

Requires the "Player Location Service" addon to be installed on the Minecraft server. 
_I haven't published that yet, so instructions TBD._

## Tech Stack

Part of the motivation for this project was to try out some different Java libraries that I was interested in.

_Yes, this project **is** over-engineered for its size._
